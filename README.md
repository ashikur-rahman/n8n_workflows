# n8n_workflows
💡 Just finished building a no-code workflow using n8n that automatically:
  - Captures leads from a form
  - Updates Google Sheets instantly
  - Sends custom Gmail replies (based on client budget)
  - Notifies me about new leads in real-time
✅ Integrated Google Sheets & Gmail with OAuth2.
 ⚙️ Used conditional logic (Switch + Merge) to personalize responses.

##If you’re a recruiter, automation engineer, or founder — imagine this running 24/7 nurturing your leads!
 Would love to collaborate or optimize similar or more advance flows. 💬
