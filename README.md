# n8n_workflows
💡 Just finished building a no-code workflow using n8n that automatically:
  - Captures leads from a form
  - Updates Google Sheets instantly
  - Sends custom Gmail replies (based on client budget)
  - Notifies me about new leads in real-time
✅ Integrated Google Sheets & Gmail with OAuth2.
 ⚙️ Used conditional logic (Switch + Merge) to personalize responses.

##If you’re a recruiter, automation engineer, or founder — imagine this running 24/7 nurturing your leads!
 Would love to collaborate or optimize similar or more advance flows. 💬

🚀 Built an Autonomous AI Agent that Manages Google Calendar & Sheets — Powered by GPT + n8n
💡 I just created an AI-driven automation system using n8n that combines OpenAI GPT models, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets for full conversational task management.
Here’s what it does 👇
- 🧠 Uses GPT as the Chat Model (AI Agent node)
- 🗣 Responds intelligently when messages are received
- 📅 Creates, retrieves, and manages events in Google Calendar
- 📊 Logs all interactions & events directly in Google Sheets
- 🔁 Can update or read any row dynamically — no manual syncing needed
- ⚙️ The agent maintains memory context, meaning it remembers conversations and executes commands like:
“Add meeting with Alex tomorrow at 2 PM” → ✅ Instantly creates a Calendar event & updates Sheets log.
📂 Tech stack:
 - n8n (AI Agent, Google integrations)
 - OpenAI GPT API (chat logic)
 - Google Calendar + Sheets APIs
 - Memory management for state persistence
